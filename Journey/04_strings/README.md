## ðŸ“‚ Strings

This folder contains beginner-level exercises focused on string manipulation in Python.  
Each script practices a different concept related to iterating, filtering, or transforming text.

### Exercises

- **ex01_reverse_string.py**  
  Reverses a word entered by the user and prints it in reverse order.  
  *Practiced*: backward iteration with `for` loops, string concatenation, and indexing.

- **ex02_remove_duplicates.py**  
  Removes duplicate characters from a word while keeping the first occurrence.  
  *Practiced*: conditional membership checking with `if ... not in` and string accumulation.

- **ex03_count_vowels.py**  
  Counts the number of vowels in a given word and prints the total.  
  *Practiced*: string traversal, condition validation with `in`, and numeric accumulation.

- Iteration over strings using `for` loops.  
- Building and filtering strings dynamically.  
- Applying membership checks (`in`, `not in`) for validation.  
- Understanding accumulator logic in the context of text processing.
