## ðŸ“‚ Strings

This folder contains beginner-level exercises focused on string manipulation in Python.  
Each script practices a different concept related to iterating, filtering, or transforming text.

### Exercises

- **ex01_reverse_string.py**  
  Reverses a word entered by the user and prints it in reverse order.  
  *Practiced*: backward iteration with `for` loops, string concatenation, and indexing.

- **ex02_remove_duplicates.py**  
  Removes duplicate characters from a word while keeping the first occurrence.  
  *Practiced*: conditional membership checking with `if ... not in` and string accumulation.

- **ex03_count_vowels.py**  
  Counts the number of vowels in a given word and prints the total.  
  *Practiced*: string traversal, condition validation with `in`, and numeric accumulation.

- **ex04_palindrome_check.py**  
  Checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward).  
  *Practiced*: string normalization, reversal, and conditional comparison.

- **ex05_count_words.py**  
  Counts how many words are in a sentence entered by the user.  
  *Practiced*: splitting strings into lists, measuring list length, and formatted output.
