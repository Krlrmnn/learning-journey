## ðŸ“‚ Conditionals

This folder contains beginner-friendly exercises to practice conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).  
The focus is on learning how to control program flow and apply logical checks.

### Exercises
- **ex01_number_sign.py**  
  Ask the user for a number and determine if it is positive, negative, or zero.

- **ex02_age_group.py**  
  Classify a person as minor, adult, or senior citizen based on their age.  
  Practiced **chained comparisons** for ranges.

- **ex03_max_of_three.py**  
  Determine the largest of three numbers.  
  - Solution 1: Using conditionals (`if/elif/else`).  
  - Solution 2: Using Pythonâ€™s built-in `max()` function.  
  *Note: Both solutions are kept to show different approaches.*

- **ex04_grade_classifier.py**  
  Assign a grade (Aâ€“F) based on the userâ€™s score. Practiced **ranges with chained comparisons**.

- **ex05_even_or_odd.py**  
  Check whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator `%`.

### Notes
This block introduced:
- How to build conditions with `if/elif/else`.  
- Chained comparisons for cleaner range checks.  
- Two different approaches to solving the same problem (manual logic vs. built-ins).  
- Basic application of the modulus operator `%`.
