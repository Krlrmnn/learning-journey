# üìù Text Analyzer & Transformer

This folder contains a Python mini-project focused on **interactive text analysis and transformation**.  
It practices function design, string manipulation, input handling, and modular scripting.

---

## Modules

### **analyzer_functions.py**
Contains the core functions for analyzing and transforming text.  
**Practiced:** function design, string processing, returning structured results, and handling multiple transformation modes.

---

### **text_analyzer.py**
Provides an interactive menu for the user to choose actions: analyze text, transform text, or exit.  
**Practiced:** input handling, menu design, function calls, and integrating modules for interactive execution.

## Features

This mini-project allows you to:

- Count words, letters, and sentence lengths in a text.  
- Identify the frequency of each word.  
- Transform text to uppercase, lowercase, title case, or reversed text.  
- Use a simple terminal menu to select the desired action.

## Notes

This project introduced:

- Defining and calling reusable Python functions.  
- Handling user input and validating choices.  
- Conditional logic for menu selection and transformation modes.  
- Iterating over strings and lists for text analysis.  
- Building modular, readable, and maintainable Python code.  
- Structuring scripts for interactive execution, ready for future `main()` integration.
