# Module 06 – Data Structures & Comprehensions

This module focuses on mastering how Python handles and transforms data efficiently using lists, dictionaries, and comprehensions.

---

## Overview

### Core topics:
- Lists and dictionaries (creation, indexing, nesting)
- Filtering and transforming data
- List comprehensions
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Clean and readable Python patterns

### Objective:
Move from writing code that *works* → to writing code that is *elegant, fast, and production-ready*.

## Exercises

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `ex01_filtering_transforming.py` | Filtering active users and transforming names (loop vs comprehension) |
| `ex02_dict_transformation.py` | Transforming and filtering dictionary data (prices, conversions) |
| `ex03_nested_comprehensions.py` | Applying comprehensions on nested data (grades, averages) |

---

## Notes

Each exercise includes:
- A **classic version** using loops (for clarity)
- A **comprehension version** (for clean, concise logic)

This module prepares the ground for **automation scripting (Module 07)**, where these skills will be used to handle real data from logs, files, and APIs.
