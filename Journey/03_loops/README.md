## ðŸ“‚ Loops

This folder contains beginner-friendly exercises to practice repetition structures (`for`, `while`).  
The focus is on learning how to repeat tasks either for a fixed range or while a condition is true.

### Exercises

- **ex01_count_to_ten.py**  
  Prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

- **ex02_sum_numbers.py**  
  Ask the user for a number `N` and calculate the sum of all numbers from `1` to `N`.  
  - Practiced using a **for loop** with an accumulator variable.

- **ex03_password_attempts.py**  
  Simulate a login system where the user has 3 attempts to enter the correct password.  
  - Practiced using a **while loop** with a counter.  
  - Introduced the use of `break` to exit the loop early when the password is correct.

- **ex04_factorial.py**  
  Computes the factorial of a number using a loop. Refuerza el uso de acumuladores.  

- **ex05_multiplication_table.py**  
  Displays the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.  

- **ex06_countdown.py**  
  Prints a countdown from a given number down to 1 using a `for` loop.  

- **ex07_guess_the_number.py**  
  Random number guessing game between 1 and 10. Uses `while` loop and condition flags to repeat until guessed correctly.

### Notes
This block introduced:
- `for` loops â†’ iterating over a fixed range of numbers.  
- `while` loops â†’ repeating actions while a condition is true.  
- Accumulator variables to track sums or totals.  
- Counters to limit the number of repetitions.  
- Using `break` or `flags` to stop loops early when a condition is satisfied.  
- Formatting repetitive outputs (like tables) with `for`.
