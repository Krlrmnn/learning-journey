# DevOps / SRE Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning path towards becoming a **DevOps Engineer** with long-term aspirations to **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** and leadership roles.  

The first stage is building strong fundamentals in **Python for automation**, and from there progressing into the DevOps ecosystem.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder includes:
- Standalone `.py` exercises for practice.
- A `README.md` describing the exercises inside.
- Notes → short explanations or references in Markdown for quick review.

## 🚀 Roadmap
### Current Stage
- ✅ Python Basics (conditionals, loops, functions, error handling)  
- 🔄 Python Intermediate (data structures, file handling, modules)

### Next Stages
1. Linux (bash, scripting, permissions, processes, networking basics)  
2. Git & GitHub (branching, collaboration, best practices)  
3. Docker (containers, images, Dockerfiles, registries)  
4. Terraform (infrastructure as code)  
5. AWS (core services: EC2, S3, IAM, networking)  
6. Kubernetes (clusters, pods, deployments, scaling)  
7. CI/CD pipelines and monitoring (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+** (for automation)  
- **Linux (Ubuntu on WSL2)**  
- **Git & GitHub**  
- *(future)* Docker, Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a **practical skillset** to be job-ready in ~2 years.  
- Use Python as a tool for automation, not an end goal.  
- Transition into **DevOps workflows** and ultimately SRE.  
- Document everything in English to strengthen communication skills.
