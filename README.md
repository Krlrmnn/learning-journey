# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my Python learning path focused on **DevOps and Cloud Engineering**.  
The content is now organized by **topics** instead of daily logs, making it easier to navigate and review.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder includes:
- Small exercises as standalone `.py` files.
- A `README.md` describing the exercises inside.
- Notes → simple explanations or documentation in Markdown for quick reference.

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Python as a tool for **automation**.
- Practice solving small problems to prepare for **DevOps workflows**.
- Document all exercises in English to improve technical writing and communication.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **VS Code + WSL2 (Ubuntu)**
